        <h2>ðŸ’¬ Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate frontend developer with a keen interest in creating
          beautiful, user-friendly digital experiences. I enjoy transforming
          ideas into functional products and continuously learning new
          technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in the power of clean code, thoughtful design, and
          continuous growth. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring new
          tools or sharing knowledge with the developer community.

        <h2>âœ¨ Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Remember that progress is not linear. Youâ€™ve come a long way from
          where you started, and every challenge is a chance to grow. Donâ€™t
          compare your beginning to someone elseâ€™s middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stay curious, keep learning, and always remember why you started
          coding. Celebrate small wins, embrace lessons, and be kind to yourself
          and others.

          I'm fascinated by the intersection of design and technology. The best
          products not only look beautiful but also feel intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in collaboration, mentorship, and sharing knowledge. Whether
          through open-source projects or helping others grow, Iâ€™m committed to
          contributing positively to the developer community.
